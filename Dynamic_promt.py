# Step-by-Step Implementation
# Implementing dynamic prompt adaptation involves a structured approach, from understanding user context to leveraging advanced AI techniques. Each step ensures seamless interaction and improved response accuracy.

# Step1: Set Up Your Environment
# To get started, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. Here, we are using a Hugging Face conversational model along with PyTorch. Install the required libraries:
pip install transformers torch
# Next, set up the model and tokenizer. We are using “Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct,” but you can replace it with any conversational model available on Hugging Face.


from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Load the Hugging Face model and tokenizer
model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Check if a GPU is available and move the model to GPU
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = model.to(device)


# Why This Setup?

# Hugging Face provides pre-trained models, saving you the effort of training from scratch.
# Using GPU (if available) accelerates model inference, especially for large-scale models like Qwen.

# Step2: Define the Dynamic Prompt Function
# This function dynamically combines user input, previous conversation context, and optional feedback to guide the AI model’s responses. It creates a structured and adaptable query.

def dynamic_prompt(user_input, context, feedback=None):
    """
    Create a dynamic prompt combining context, user input, and optional feedback.

    Parameters:
        user_input (str): The user's latest input.
        context (str): The conversation history.
        feedback (str): Optional feedback to guide the response tone or style.

    Returns:
        str: A combined prompt for the AI model.

    user_prompt = f"User: {user_input}\nAssistant:"
    feedback_prompt = f"\nFeedback: {feedback}" if feedback else ""
    return base_prompt + context_prompt + user_prompt + feedback_prompt

# Base Prompt -> Sets the default behavior of the assistant.
# Context -> Ensures continuity in multi-turn conversations.
# Feedback -> Dynamically adjusts the style or tone based on user preferences

# Step3: Generate Responses with the AI Model

# OUTPUT

# A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn and make predictions based on input data. It’s named after the human brain because it works in a way that mimics how neurons in our brains communicate with each other through electrical signals. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” which process information by passing it from one layer to another until the final output is produced. 
# These networks can be used for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language.

# Step4: Implement an Interactive Chat Session
# This interactive loop lets you have a dynamic conversation with the AI model, updating the context with each user input

def chat_with_model():
    """
    Start an interactive chat session with the Hugging Face model.
    """
    context = ""  # Conversation history
    print("Start chatting with the AI (type 'exit' to stop):")
    while True:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        # Optionally gather feedback for tone/style adjustments
        feedback = input("Feedback (Optional, e.g., 'Be more formal'): ").strip() or None

        # Create the dynamic prompt
        prompt = dynamic_prompt(user_input, context, feedback)
        print(f"\nDynamic Prompt Used:\n{prompt}\n")  # For debugging

        # Generate and display the AI response
        try:
            response = generate_response(prompt)
            print(f"AI: {response}\n")

            # Update context
            context += f"User: {user_input}\nAssistant: {response}\n"
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            break


#     Dynamic Updates -> Adds user queries and AI responses to the context for smooth conversation flow.
# Optional Feedback -> Allows users to refine the AI’s tone or style in real-time.
# # Error Handling -> Prevents the loop from crashing due to unexpected issues.

# Challenges in Dynamic Prompt Adaptation
# Dynamic prompt adaptation comes with its own set of challenges, such as managing ambiguous inputs and balancing response accuracy. Addressing these hurdles is crucial for creating effective and reliable AI systems.

# Context Overflow and Token Limits
# Dynamic prompt adaptation faces several challenges that require thoughtful solutions to ensure robustness and efficiency. Managing long conversations is difficult when the context grows beyond the model’s token limit. Truncating older exchanges may result in losing critical information, leading to irrelevant or disjointed responses.

# For example, a customer support chatbot assisting with a complex technical issue may forget earlier troubleshooting steps due to context truncation. To address this, smart context-trimming strategies can be implemented to prioritize retaining recent and relevant exchanges while summarizing less critical parts.

# Ambiguity in Feedback
# Users often provide vague feedback, such as “Be clearer,” which the system might struggle to interpret effectively. Ambiguity in instructions can result in suboptimal adjustments.

# For instance, a user in a study app might say, “Explain it better,” without specifying what “better” means (e.g., simpler language, more examples, or visual aids). Adding a feedback interpretation layer can parse unclear instructions into actionable refinements, such as “Simplify terms” or “Add examples,” making the system more effective.

# Resource Constraints
# Running large models requires significant computational resources, which may not be feasible for all deployments. On CPUs, inference can be slow, while at scale, the cost of GPUs and infrastructure adds up.

# For example, a startup deploying AI for real-time queries might find response times lagging during peak usage due to insufficient GPU capacity. Optimizing models through quantization or using smaller models for lightweight tasks while reserving larger ones for complex queries can help manage resources efficiently.

# Maintaining Coherence in Responses
# As conversations grow longer, the AI may lose focus or produce irrelevant responses due to poorly maintained context or unclear instructions.

# For instance, in a long discussion about travel planning, the AI might suddenly suggest unrelated activities, breaking the conversational flow. Regularly refining prompt structures can reinforce the focus on key topics and improve response clarity, ensuring coherent interactions.

# Ethical Risks and Bias
# Training data biases can inadvertently lead to inappropriate or harmful responses, especially in sensitive applications like mental health support or education.

# For example, a chatbot might unintentionally normalize harmful behavior when misinterpreting a user’s context or tone. Incorporating bias mitigation strategies during fine-tuning and using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) can ensure ethical alignment and safer interactions.

# Scalability Under Load
# Handling a large number of simultaneous conversations can strain infrastructure and degrade response quality or speed during high-traffic periods.

# For instance, an AI assistant on an e-commerce platform might face delays during a flash sale, frustrating customers with slow responses. Implementing asynchronous processing, load balancing, and caching mechanisms for frequently asked questions can reduce server load and maintain performance during peak usage.

# Conclusion
# By addressing these challenges, dynamic prompt adaptation can become a robust solution for interactive and responsive AI systems. Dynamic prompt adaptation is not just a technical advancement, it is a leap toward making AI systems more intuitive and human-like. By harnessing its potential, we can create interactive experiences that are personalized, engaging, and capable of adapting to the diverse needs of users. Let’s embrace these challenges as stepping stones to building smarter, and better AI solutions!
