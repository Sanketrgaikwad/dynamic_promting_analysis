Implementing **dynamic prompting** in your existing chatbot that uses OpenAI's services involves creating logic to generate or adjust prompts based on the user's input and context. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

#  1. Understand current Chatbot's Workflow
# Ensure you know how the chatbot currently processes user input:
# - Does it directly pass user input to the OpenAI model as a prompt?
# - Is there any pre-processing or context maintenance?



# 2. Identify Points for Dynamic Prompting**
# Dynamic prompting can be applied in:
# Refining Queries: Tailoring SQL queries or responses based on user input.
# Maintaining Context: Adjusting prompts based on prior user interactions.
# Handling Ambiguity: Asking clarifying questions dynamically when user input is unclear.



#. Modify the Prompt Generation Logic

# #Basic Dynamic Prompting Workflow:
# 1. Pre-process User Input: Analyze the user’s input for intent, keywords, or prior context.
# 2. Generate Contextual Prompts: Use templates, conditional logic, or embeddings to tailor the prompt dynamically.
# 3. Pass the Tailored Prompt to OpenAI.



#4. Implement Dynamic Prompting**

Here’s an example of a Python implementation with OpenAI's API:

#a. Example Without Context:
# python
import openai

def generate_sql_query(user_input):
    prompt = f"Generate an SQL query for the following request: {user_input}"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()

user_input = "Show me total sales grouped by region"
query = generate_sql_query(user_input)
print(query)


#b. Example With Context and Dynamic Prompting:**
# python
import openai

# Context store (could be replaced with a database or session data)
user_context = {
    "previous_query": None,
    "current_table": "sales_table",
}

def generate_sql_query(user_input, context):
    # Analyze user input and maintain context
    if "group by" in user_input.lower():
        prompt = f"Refine the previous SQL query to include GROUP BY based on this request: {user_input}. " \
                 f"Use the table {context['current_table']}."
    else:
        prompt = f"Generate an SQL query for the following request: {user_input}. " \
                 f"Use the table {context['current_table']}."

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    # Save query in context
    context["previous_query"] = response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
    return context["previous_query"]

user_input = "Show me total sales grouped by region"
query = generate_sql_query(user_input, user_context)
print(query)




#5. Introduce Context Management

# Maintain user session context to track:
# - Previous queries (`previous_query`).
# - Specific table or schema in use (`current_table`).
# - User preferences (e.g., specific filters or column names).

# For example, store the context in a database, session storage, or a cache (e.g., Redis).



#6. Use Fine-Tuned Models
# If your use case requires specific SQL outputs, consider fine-tuning the model with examples of dynamic prompts and their desired outputs.



# 7. Test and Iterate
#  Test the chatbot with various user inputs.
#  Analyze if the dynamic prompts are helping improve accuracy.
#  Collect feedback and refine your prompt logic.



# 8. Advanced Enhancements
# Intent Detection: Use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) to detect user intent and refine prompts accordingly.
# Knowledge Graphs: Incorporate domain knowledge for better context.
# Chaining Queries: Use the OpenAI API in a multi-step manner to clarify user requests.
